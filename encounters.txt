- Weather conditions are bad and someone has to sacrifice themselves to save the party. And the player has to choose to eat someone from their party, they're trapped and running out of food.

- A powerful enemy is trapping the PCs and one of them has to sacrifice themselves to distract the enemy (necromancer? the person comes back at a later point)

	- have to put together a spell to stop the weather, find the ingredients and figure out how to cast the spell through knowledge checks.

[FROM LORE] - PCs are lost in the woods, they're being lead down a maze and many of the ways lead to traps/fights, as the PCs go on at some point there is a shroud of darkness, you hear noises and when you're back up everything seems normal

	- before the forest there's a bar where a character takes a woman/creature upstairs to fuck and that's when they're switched out and they can switch out the other person later in the forest and they're trying to lead them to the bad endings
